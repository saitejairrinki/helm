Coffee Shop Website Deployment on Kubernetes: Management and Monitoring

Commands Reference:

1. View Deployments:
   kubectl get deployment -A

2. View Exposed Services:
   kubectl get service -A
   kubectl get svc wave-cafe -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'

3. Monitor HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA):
   kubectl get hpa -A

4. Monitor HPA and Watch Live Autoscaling (CPU Load):
   kubectl get hpa -A -w

Instructions:

1. Use `kubectl get deployment -A` to see all deployments in your Kubernetes cluster. Look for your coffee shop website deployment to ensure it's running as expected.

2. Utilize `kubectl get service -A` to check the services exposed by your coffee shop website deployment. This provides information about how users can access your website.

3. Keep an eye on HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) with `kubectl get hpa -A`. This allows you to monitor autoscaling behavior based on resource metrics such as CPU utilization.

4. For real-time monitoring of HPA and observing autoscaling when CPU load increases, use `kubectl get hpa -A -w`. This command provides a live view of HPA activities.

Ensure to make any necessary adjustments to your deployment configuration or HPA settings based on the observed metrics to maintain optimal performance and scalability for your coffee shop website.

Happy brewing and scaling!
